# recipe_management

A new Flutter project.

## About this project
AppFacade serves as a data source for both local and remote data. 
Behind AppFacade is LocalRepository and APIRepository. This makes us to easily switch out local and remote data sources


## With more time
Add RouteSettings file and use an app router to manage navigation routes. This would be most appropriate if the app grows in size and complexity.

Add Mockoon to replace mocks for widget testing

Add pull-to-refresh on recipes view

Add a more robust NoSQL persistence solution such as Hive
